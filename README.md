# Age_and_Gender_Classification


## Dataset

In this project, to test the efficiency of the model we have used the Adience benchmark which is designed for age and gender classification task. The dataste needs some preprocessing which has been done as a part of the project. The preprocessed version of the dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d0qAw7UvqKhXcu_7I6yTv3mGrxhSLD2Z?usp=sharing
